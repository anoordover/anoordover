## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work for Het CAK in the Netherlands and develop backend functionality in .Net.

Currently we are implementing an exchange with member states using EESSI for "Actual cost claims" (S_BUC_19, AW_BUC_05) and "Fixed amounts" (S_BUC_21).
The technologies we use are:
- EF Core
- Oracle DB
- ActiveMq classic
- MassTransit (@phatboyg)

Our usage of ActiveMq was my drive to implement an ActiMq Classic host component for the Aspire CommunityToolkit that could be used by ActiveMq.
I did this because MassTransit expects a scheme "activemq" in the connectionstring.

Support for ActiveMq Artemis will be available soon.
