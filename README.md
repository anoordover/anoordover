## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work for Het CAK in the Netherlands and develop backend functionality in .Net.

Currently we are implementing an exchange with member states using EESSI for "Actual cost claims" (S_BUC_19, AW_BUC_05) and "Fixed amounts" (S_BUC_21).
The technologies we use are:
- EF Core
- Oracle DB
- ActiveMq classic
- MassTransit (@phatboyg)

## Aspire CommunityToolkit

### ActiveMQ

Our usage of ActiveMq was my drive to implement an [ActiMq Classic](https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/) host component for the Aspire CommunityToolkit that could be used by ActiveMq.
I did this because MassTransit expects a scheme "activemq" in the connectionstring.
[ActiveMq Artemis](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/) is now also available.

### Papercut SMTP

I also implemented a hosting component for testing integrations with SMTP using [Papercut SMTP](https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut-SMTP).
